## NOTES
***The version hosted on gh-pages does not have full functionality of dynamic componenets including the forms and reviews, fetching data from a server.***

</br>

***Demo GIFs are not accurate representation of current state of application as it is constantly being updated. For current static version, visit gh-pages link***

</br>

***This Project was made possible due to the hard work of devs present at RAWG and ITAD***
